	<div class="row2 red"><p class="text1">"Metro stations can get pretty jam-packed from high amounts of people who ride the trains. Chad Yeng, a local Metro rail rider, rides the train two to three times a week. He stated, “Large groups of people can make it harder to get on.” When the train is at full capacity, people can always find room somewhere on the train or bus to stand and wait for an open seat at the next stop. 
Large groups of people can affect the ridership and accessibility of disabled riders. Occasionally, the capacity of people on the train is very large so there are rails and bars for people to hold onto."</p></div>

	<div class="row2 orange"><p class="text1">"Metro is financially accessible to most riders. According to Metro’s website, 46 percent of bus riders have a household income of $15,000 or less, and 28 percent of train users earn $15,000 or less. The price for a single trip on either train or bus is $1.75.Students K-12 can purchase fares for $1,  and seniors, disabled and those with medicare assistance can purchase fares for 75 cents. These options help make Metro financially accessible." </p></div>

	<div class="row2 red"><p class="text1">"Despite the services provided, the Metro can be a dangerous form of transportation for those who are physically disabled in some way. Bianca Ramirez, a journalist for the Southern California Public Radio, reported an incident of a blind man falling onto train tracks in the Metro Los Angeles red line. He wasn’t injured but was stuck under the train and had to wait for the fire department to rescue him. 
Isaak Mourning, 17, a current junior at Da Vinci Communications High School and local Metro rider suggested that “They should have people at all stations to help assist people that can’t get around on their own since it should be accessible to all people.” </p></div>
